       The main objective of the BTech (ECE) program is to equip students with necessary core competency to succeed long-term in engineering/ entrepreneurship careers after completing their B.Tech. and are preparing to undertake PG studies and research as career options.
As a discipline, ECE focuses on the design of underlying hardware systems. Our curriculum is directed to applications in major areas such as telecommunications, energy and electronics sectors, while encouraging development of necessary skills for integration of hardware and software components. We believe that many creative opportunities exist at the boundaries of traditional CSE and ECE, and have accordingly planned for cross-training of students across disciplinary boundaries. The curriculum for ECE therefore has many courses in common with the CSE program initially. Thereafter, the program in year 3 & 4 is structured to allow customization by individual students based on their own personal preferences.
